Music player for user48736353001 aka Aphex Twin mp3s

This program is a modification of dlmklr's SongPlay11 mp3-player app built in Processing. This program is a native Processing app designed to serve as a jukebox of sorts for playing all of the tracks leaked by Aphex Twin as user48736353001. I stripped out some of the more advanced features of the original mp3 player it's built from to concentrate on this one specific project to play this single collection of mp3s. 

Dependencies
------------

This program does not come with the mp3s. You can download those from a torrent file or do a search for "Aphex Twin user48736353001." You can alter the path in the code to where it's located on your computer so it automatically starts up every time. Or you'll have to use the load feature in the program when you run it.
Note that this program can be easily modified to play any folder of mp3s out of the box.
